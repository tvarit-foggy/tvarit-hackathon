General Info : Image stylization has been studied for over two decades in the image processing domain as non-photorealistic rendering.
Creating artistic filters for images has attracted much interest in recent times, and the Neural Style Transfer with CNNs have enabled new possibilities to transfer artistic style from a famous painting on to the desired image. All it needs is a trained CNN, a style image as a reference for the style, and a content image for the stylization. Not everyone is blessed with artistic skills to create beautiful paintings, and unfortunately, not every artist has enough time to serve everyone. Therefore, there is a need to develop an application for people to access any artist and for the artist to sell his artwork. We think Neural Style Transfer serves this purpose in creating a platform for people to create new artistic style images
